<p>"There was no warning; up from our sleep we jump, we did not have time to gather our clothing; just as we got up from our sleep we ran for safety in the best way we knew. I heard very much firing all around us. I did not look to see whom it was that was doing all that firing but we all knew that Long Hair Custer was out hunting the Indians and we knew that he had found us."
</p>
-Mrs. B.K. Young Bird, Cheyenne, 1937
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"The military viewed Custer's 'glorious victory' as a brilliant success achieved during a fierce battle with Black Kettle's hostile Cheyennes. But the Indian Bureau held a different view and labeled the affair a massacre of innocent Indians. Humanitarians in the East denounced Custer's attack as a 'cold-blooded butchery' of women and children."
</p>
-Richard G. Hardorff, Custer historian
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"Black Kettle, the leading proponent and spokesman for peace among his entire tribe, was struck down and silenced forever at Washita, an action that reverberated for years within Cheyenne society while clouding the issue of peace in the near and distant future...The days of freedom were gone forever."
</p>
-Jerome Greene, historian

<p>"Sheridan initiated a winter campaign against the Cheyennes, the concept had been applied earlier, including by Brigadier General James H. Carleton and Colonel Christopher Carson against the Navahoes in 1863-64 and Colonel Patrick E. Connor against the Northwestern Shoshones in 1863. Dawn attacks on Indian villages had also happened before Washita, all with deadly consequences...The 'dawn attack' scenario, no doubt influenced to some degree by what happened at Washita in 1868 and rationalized as 'battle' partly as a result of that encounter, played out time and again over subsequent years."
</p>
-Jerome Greene, historian
