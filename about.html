<h2>About</h2>

<p>After nearly 60 years of designating historic sites that fit into a distinct national narrative, the National Park Service
faced new challenges to historic interpretation at the end of the 20th century. The NPS, in an effort to incorporate more 
diversity in their sites, began to consider a broader framework for historic commemoration. Controversy over the name "Custer
Battlefield National Monument" highlighted a public struggle which ultimately ended with a more neutral "Little Bighorn Battlefield 
National Monument" in 1991. 
</p>
<p>Despite the Park Service's new commitment to less narrow interpretations, something strange happened at the end of the 20th
century. Two similar events from the 19th century's so called "Indian Wars" earned National Park designations with strikingly 
different names: Washita Battlefield National Historic Site and Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site.
</p>
<p>Sand Creek and Washita were sites of violence and, arguably, both contain elements of shame for the American government due
 to the nature of the attacks and the simultaneous betrayal of government officials. Both sites demonstrate the conflict of 
 history and memory and a country that has difficulty coming to terms with its violent past.  How can Washita be considered
 a battle?  
 </P>
 
 <p><i>Washita: A Problem in History & Memory</i> looks at the history of Washita and the associated language surrounding 
 it in an attempt to understand how it was remembered as a battle but also in an attempt to set the historical record straight.
 This project uses a digital format to introduce the public to Washita and to engage it in a conversation about history.
 What does the public think about the name on the National Park sign? Should it remain?  All visitors are encouraged to leave
 thoughtful comments which will be used in another component of the website that explores public memory of Washita in the 21st
 Century.
 </p>
 Thank you for visiting!
