<h2>Key Historical Figures</h2>


<p>Although Washita is not very well-known in popular history, some of the most famous figures in American History were partially responsible
 for the tragic outcome.  George Armstrong Custer, Philip Sheridan, and William Tecumseh Sherman are all famous for military battles fought 
 elsewhere, but all played significant roles in Washita. The people who are forgotten or at least little remembered are the victims of the 
 so-called Indian Wars.  The Cheyenne tribe had spent hundreds of years on the Great Plains before settlers moved in. Black Kettle might be 
 the most famous Cheyenne in history because he was the peace chief who was present during two of the tribe's most tragic moments: Washita 
 and the Sand Creek Massacre.

<blockquote><i>"There was no warning; up from our sleep we jump, we did not have time to gather our clothing; just as we got up from our 
sleep we ran for safety in the best way we knew. I heard very much firing all around us. I did not look to see whom it was that was doing all
 that firing but we all knew that Long Hair Custer was out hunting the Indians and we knew that he had found us."

<blockquote><i>"Black Kettle, the leading proponent and spokesman for peace among his entire tribe, was struck down and silenced forever at 
Washita, an action that reverberated for years within Cheyenne society while clouding the issue of peace in the near and distant future...
The days of freedom were gone forever."

<blockquote><i>"The military viewed Custer's 'glorious victory' as a brilliant success achieved during a fierce battle with Black Kettle's hostile 
Cheyennes. But the Indian Bureau held a different view and labeled the affair a massacre of innocent Indians. Humanitarians in the East 
denounced Custer's attack as a 'cold-blooded butchery' of women and children."

<div class="kfsheridan">
<img class="sheridan" src="images/sheridan.gif" alt="Philip Sheridan">
<p>"Sheridan initiated a winter campaign against the Cheyennes, the concept had been applied earlier, including by Brigadier General James 
H. Carleton and Colonel Christopher Carson against the Navahoes in 1863-64 and Colonel Patrick E. Connor against the Northwestern Shoshones 
in 1863. Dawn attacks on Indian villages had also happened before Washita, all with deadly consequences...The 'dawn attack' scenario, no 
doubt influenced to some degree by what happened at Washita in 1868 and rationalized as 'battle' partly as a result of that encounter, played
 out time and again over subsequent years."
