<p>I was born and raised in Colorado. I earned a bachelor's degree in International Affairs with a minor in Economics from the University of Colorado in Boulder.  After working as an English teacher in Seoul, Korea for nearly four years I returned to earn a master's degree at George Mason University. My research interests include the nineteenth-century American West and the National Park Service.</p>
	
<h2>Creating History in New Media</h2>

<p>Hopefully historians will figure out how to be relevant in the internet age. This page provides information about me and links to my attempts at designing pages of content that are related to history. I guess.</p>
