<img class="utley" src="images/utley.gif" alt="Robert Utley">
Robert Utley was and is one of the most influential American Western historians.  Utley has published at least eighteen books on the American West and most of his publications emphasize military history for both academic and popular history audiences. He is a founder of the Western History Association and its journal the <i>Western Historical Quarterly</i>. Utley previously served as Chief Historian for the National Park Service and continues to serve on advisory boards for the NPS. Utleyâ€™s influence on American Western history and the <a href="utley.html">language</a> related to it cannot be understated when attempting to understand how interpretations endure in the face of controversy.

<img class="hoig" src="images/hoig.gif" alt="Stan Hoig">
<p>Stan Hoig, a native Oklahoman, was a respected and authoritative 20th century historian of the Plains Indians and the related military history. He made several significant contributions to Native American history and challenged traditional interpretations. Hoig was clear that he considered Custer's attack at Washita a massacre; however, curiously, he continued to defer to <a href="hoig.html">traditional language</a> associated with Washita when he wrote about it.
