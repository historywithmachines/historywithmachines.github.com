<h3>Utley's position on Washita can be observed throughout his distinguished writing career.  The following passage is in his 2004 memoir:
</h3>

<blockquote>
<img class="utley" src="images/utley.gif" alt="Robert Utley">
"At my first meeting of the secretary's advisory board, held in October 1964 in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, I painfully discovered that undiplomatic candor could get one into serious trouble. The issue was the significance and park potential of the Washita Battlefield in Oklahoma, where General Custer won a signal victory over the Cheyennes in 1868. Here was a subject I knew much better than Frank Masland, a mustachioed, distinguished-looking carpet mogul from Pennsylvania and long a power on the board. When he gave his opinion that the Washita was a terrible massacre of women and children, I stood to say that, to put it bluntly, Frank Masland did not know what he was talking about."
